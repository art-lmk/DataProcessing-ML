# DataProcessing-ML
This is a step to step guide on how you can process data and prepare it for the model(model of your choice) before it goes to your model .
The dataset used is life expectancy data.csv from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)

Data praeparation and processing involves cleaning data( filling missing values, has hashtags,has having duplicates, incorrect data types between the data columns ). 
Data preprocessing involves processing of data before it goes to your ML model. We use EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) so that one can kniw what algorithm to use or how to prepare your data.
Data encoding now involves coverting object into numerals. For the data to fit the model, the whole dta is supposed to be encoded in numbers. You can choose to use label encoding or hot encoding(using dummies)
